Each supported platform should have a pre-built binary + headers in builds/{rust-target-triple}.

----------------

MacOS / Linux notes:

Build libmp3lame:
    ./configure --prefix=/PREFIX --enable-static --disable-shared CFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch arm64" LDFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch arm64"
    set LAME_LOCATION to the prefix
FFmpeg tag to build from: n5.1.2
Run ffmpeg_configure_tiny.sh in the clone ffmpeg repo.
Copy build_output and rename it with the target triple putting it in builds/

----------------

Windows notes:

The easiest way to build FFMpeg is with vcpkg.
Install vcpkg.
Create a copy of the ffmpeg port (say ffmpeg-tiny).
In the portfile.cmake, after the configuration is done, but before the build starts, edit the configure options. Include all the options above between --disable-everything and the final --enable-parser inclusively.
Then do vcpkg install ffmpeg-tiny
Copy the resulting build from vcpkg/installed to the correctly named builds folder.

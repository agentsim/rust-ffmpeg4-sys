This repo is originally forked from the excellent work of meh.
link:https://github.com/meh/rust-ffmpeg-sys[]

== Supported versions

Version of this crate corresponds version of ffmpeg it build with. Currently it is 4.2.2.

== Building

To build with locally installed ffmpeg libraries you'll need a working
pkg-config. I use it on Debian Buster without any problems.

To build with bundled ffmpeg sources when system installed ffmpeg is not
available, you'll need `yasm` installed.
